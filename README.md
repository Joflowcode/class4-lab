## Lab 02

### Reflections and Comments
* Everything went pretty smoothly. I followed along during the lecture to get the initial scaffolding of the project repo set-up. I also added the HTML structure to the index file and got some of my JavaScript code ready. The instructions for the lab were pretty straight forward. I'm understanding the 'if' / 'else if' statements. I only added a little styling to the HTML. Since the focus of this lab was JavaScript, I made sure I was understanding that concept. I expected this lab to take me an hour and a half to two hours, and it took me a little over two hours.
